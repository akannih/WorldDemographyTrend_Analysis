### Project Description: World Demographic Trends Analysis for the World Bank

As a Data Scientist employed by the World Bank, I was tasked with analyzing and visualizing the world’s demographic trends over two significant periods—1960 and 2013. The primary objective was to compare how life expectancy and fertility rates evolved over time, providing valuable insights for policymakers and global stakeholders.

This project involved creating a series of scatterplots that illustrate **Life Expectancy (y-axis)** and **Fertility Rate (x-axis)** by country. These visualizations were categorized by **Country Regions** to offer a clear, region-based understanding of demographic shifts.

Key highlights of the project include:
- **Data from 1960 and 2013**: The analysis focuses on these two years to demonstrate changes in key indicators over time.
- **Regional Categorization**: The scatterplots were color-coded based on the country regions (e.g., Africa, Europe, Asia), offering a comparative perspective across different parts of the world.
- **Python-Driven Analysis**: All data manipulation and visualizations were carried out using Python, ensuring auditability and consistency in the data processing pipeline.

In addition to visualizations, I provided insights and comparisons between the two years, focusing on the impact of economic, healthcare, and social changes on life expectancy and fertility rates across regions. This information aids in understanding long-term trends and the diverse paths countries and regions have taken in improving health outcomes and managing population growth.

This project emphasized the use of **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Seaborn** for visualizations, and a strong focus on reproducibility, essential for the World Bank's decision-making and policy creation processes.
